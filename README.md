She was a quiet girl, I judged, with smooth silky blonde hair, with gentle eyes over her long nose. Her smile was very kind and sweet; it would be a pity if she turned into her swollen mother. Unfortunately, she did.

I was walking home after a long day at work and was exhausted. The moon shone, barely illuminating the dark alley I was walking in. All I could see around me were stacks and stacks of boxes around dark trash cans the size of small cars. Mother always told me not to take this particular alley but today, I wanted to get my aching and sore body home as soon as possible. Cold wind brushed against my face. Creeped out by the alley, I hugged myself tighter, picking up the pace to continued my way home.

Crunch. Crunch. The sound of other footsteps. I stopped in my tracks, looked around me, but no one was there. Just me. Silence resonated throughout the alley. If only there was someone to say something to break the silence.
